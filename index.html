<h1>Welcome to the Mountain of Mathematics!</h1>

<p>At school, teachers train students in the Gym of Mathematics.  It's healthy, but it's repetitive and not necessarily practical.  As a guide on this proverbial Mountain of Mathematics, I hope to show students that climbing this mountain helps you see further while also developing the mental muscles that are truly important in this day and age: creative problem-solving skills.  Of course, there are many practical benefits to climbing this mountain, but at the end of the day, the best reason to climb a mountain is that the journey is fun and the views are beautiful, and that is what I ultimately hope students take away.</p>
