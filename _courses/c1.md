There will be {{ page.duration }} hours of teaching per week every {{ page.time }} over 40 weeks, and I expect students to spend about {{ page.workload }} per week reviewing the material and doing homework. The total time spent in this course should be about 160 hours over the year.  The content focuses on multichoice or short-answer questions which feature on competitions like the AMC Junior/Intermediate, AMC 8/10, Mathex, ICAS, Otago Problem Challenge and Junior Maths Competition, and so on.

- Use a variety of probabilistic and combinatorial arguments to solve probability questions.
- Employ additive and multiplicative structure of integers in number theory problems.
- Solve problems involving other number bases.
- Employ parity arguments and modular arithmetic in number theory problems.
- Understand various geometric terms and their definitions.
- Use angles, lengths, triangles, and areas to solve planar geometry problems.
- Solve basic 3D geometry problems.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this course, students should have completed Year 6 in the NZ mathematics curriculum, or Year 5 in the Australian mathematics curriculum. In particular, students should:
- Have strong computational skills with integers, decimals, fractions, and percentages.
- Understand order of mathematical operations, common mathematical symbols, and mathematical notation.
- Be able to solve linear equations in one variable.
- Have a basic understanding of the coordinate plane.
