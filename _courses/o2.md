There will be 2 hours of teaching per week over 40 weeks, and I expect students to spend about {{ page.workload }} per week reviewing the material and doing homework. The total time spent in this course should be around 220 hours over the year.  As the follow-up to the Olympiad 1 (O1) course, this course will continue to develop creative problem-solving skills and proof-writing skills.

{% include classes.md %}  This course will start in the second half of 2026.
