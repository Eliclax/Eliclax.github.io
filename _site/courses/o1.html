<h1>Olympiad 1 (O1) Course</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Lessons:</strong> 20</li>
    <li><strong>Fee:</strong> $1,100 AUD</li>
    <li><strong>Current Time:</strong> Sun 17:30–19:30</li>
    <li><strong>Workload:</strong> 4–6 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be 2 hours of teaching per week every  over 20 weeks, and I expect students to spend about 4–6 hours per week reviewing the material and doing homework. The total time spent in this course should be around 120–180 hours over 2 terms.  As this is the first Olympiad course, there will be a heavy emphasis on understanding and writing proofs, as well as a discussion of different problem-solving strategies more relevant to proofs.</p>

  <li>be able to apply binomial theorem to determine coefficients of binomial expansions,</li>
  <li>be able to apply modular arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation) in problems,</li>
  <li>be able to solve simultaneous equations and quadratic equations,</li>
  <li>be able to sum arithmetic and geometric series,</li>
  <li>understand the relationships between the equations and graphs of lines, quadratics, and circles,</li>
  <li>be able to angle chase on parallel lines, in triangles, in circles, and in cyclic quads, and</li>
  <li>be able to spot and utilise similar triangles in solving geometry problems.</li>
</ul>
